# Project

### Create a node.js backend with express which allows you to manage a task list. The backend must have the following endpoints

    - retrieve the list of all tasks
    - retrieve the list of all undone tasks
    - Add a new task
    - Mark a task as done
    - Edit an existing task
    - delete a task (bonus)

First, the tasks can be stored in a global variable.

However, the tasks will then have to be stored in the database. The backend must therefore be connected to the database.

The project must be submitted via github

Bonus: add token verification
